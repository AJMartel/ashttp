/!\ This project is in progress
It actually DOES NOT WORK ! You can contribute but not use it.

Dependencies
============
aptitude install python-pexpect

Actual state
============
 Can lanch a program and emulate an ANSI terminal
 Show a dump of the terminal when you hit enter.

The final goal is
=================

Serve any shell application over http, like :
$ ashttp -p8080 top
to serve a top on port 8080, or :
$ ashttp -p8080 watch ls -lah /tmp
to serve an actualized directory listing of /tmp

ashttp should first send raw ascii text as an HTTP response.

TODO
====
 * FIX bugs that may be in ANSI (~vt100) terminal implementation
    * To find bugs, try ashttp top ... )o:
 * Really serve as http, actually only dumps to stdout while hitting RETURN.
